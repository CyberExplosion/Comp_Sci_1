Processing:	How to convert Dec to Hex mathematically
- Take the dec value divide by 16
- Get the remainer, assign the remainer value to be the left-most number for hex
- Continue to divide the quotient with 16
- Get another remainer, assign the remainer to be the next 2nd left-most number for hex
--- Repeat steps until the quotient is smaller than 16 ---
- The quotient that smaller than 16 is the right-most hex number
